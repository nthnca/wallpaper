These are some of my favorite desktop backgrounds packaged together into a convenient git repository. If you would like a print of one of them, I do have the original RAW versions of most of them and we can probably work out a reasonable price.

Here is generally how they are created:

- Import RAW into Photos (mac)
- Make minor adjustments to lighting, color, etc.
- Crop to 16:10.
- Export to JPG, height set to 2160 (close to 4k), quality set to medium.
